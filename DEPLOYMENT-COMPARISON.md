## Use Case Specific Recommendations

### For Gumloop Integration

**Docker + VPS** ✅

Why?
- Gumloop's "Ask AI" node works better with persistent connections
- MCP protocol benefits from stateful connections
- No execution time limits for complex queries
- Easier to add authentication layer if needed

### For Production API

**Either works, but Docker preferred**

- More control over error handling
- Better monitoring and logging
- Can add rate limiting, caching, etc.
- Easier to scale vertically if needed

### For Learning/Experimentation

**Cloudflare Workers**

- Great learning opportunity
- No server management overhead
- Can iterate quickly
- Good for understanding serverless

---

## Migration Path

If you start with Docker and later want Cloudflare Workers:

1. Docker is running, Gumloop is working ✅
2. Rewrite worker in TypeScript (when you have time)
3. Test worker in parallel
4. Switch Gumloop to worker URL
5. Keep Docker as backup

---

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "I need this working today"
**Use:** Docker + VPS
**Why:** 30 minutes to deploy, no code changes

### Scenario 2: "I want zero maintenance"
**Use:** Cloudflare Workers
**Why:** After initial rewrite, zero maintenance

### Scenario 3: "I'm on a tight budget"
**Use:** Cloudflare Workers (free tier)
**Why:** $0 vs $5-10/month

### Scenario 4: "I need complex workflows"
**Use:** Docker + VPS
**Why:** No execution time limits, full Python capabilities

### Scenario 5: "I expect high traffic spikes"
**Use:** Cloudflare Workers
**Why:** Automatic scaling to handle spikes

### Scenario 6: "I need to process large files"
**Use:** Docker + VPS
**Why:** No memory/time constraints
